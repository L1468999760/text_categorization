  today   is   to   restore   global   economic   growth   as   soon   as   possible   Yet   it   is   worrisome   to   note   that   the   surge   of   trade   protectionism   has   made   the   prospects   of   the   already   fragile   world   economy   even   worse China   and   the   European   Union   two   major   economies   and   stakeholders   in   the   world   should   take   a   responsible   attitude   and   demonstrate   their   common   clear   commitment   against   trade   protectionism   at   the   second   China E U   high level   economic   dialogue Trade   liberalization   is   the   engine   of   economic   growth   It   has   served   as   a   strong   propeller   of   economic   globalization   and   benefited   people   around   the   world   On   the   contrary   trade   protectionism     featuring   the   pursuit   of   benefits   for   one   country   at   the   expense   of   others     will   only   lead   to   retaliation   It   serves   the   interest   of   no   one The   world   economy   paid   a   heavy   price   for   the   prevalence   of   trade   protectionism   during   the   Great   Depression   in   the   1930s   which   led   to   the   contraction   of   global   trade   by   two   thirds   We   should   make   sure   that   the   same   mistake   is   not   repeated Europe   is   the   birthplace   of   free   trade   theory   and   the   E U   is   the   product   of   successful   free   trade   practices   The   removal   of   trade   barriers   promoted   formation   of   a   single   European   market   and   enhanced   development   and   prosperity   in   Europe   As   a   result   the   E U   has   grown   into   the   largest   economy   in   the   world   today China   is   firmly   committed   to   reform   and   to   opening   up   Since   its   accession   to   the   World   Trade   Organization   China s   market   has   become   much   more   open   and   its   trade   greatly   liberalized   The   current   overall   tariff   level   of   China   is   only   9.8   percent   Its   average   tariff   on   industrial   products   is   only   8.9   percent   the   lowest   among   all   developing   countries   Its   tariff   on   imported   agricultural   products   is   only   15.2   percent   which   is   not   only   lower   than   other   developing   countries   but   also   far   below   that   of   many   developed   countries The   openness   of   China s   trade   in   services   has   reached   a   level   close   to   that   of   an   average   developed   country   China   has   taken   steady   steps   to   improve   its   market   economic   system   and   legal   system   In   particular   it   has   made   remarkable   progress   in   intellectual property   rights   protection   product   quality   and   food   safety   environmental   protection   and   labor   security   China   has   also   taken   concrete   actions   against   trade   protectionism     the   Chinese   government   recently   sent   Chinese   enterprises   on   procurement   missions   to   Europe   and   the   United   States The   economies   of   China   and   the   E U   have   much   to   offer   each   other   and   our   two way   trade   holds   a   huge   potential   The   E U   is   now   China s   largest   trading   partner   and   China   is   the   second   largest   trading   partner   of   the   E U China   and   the   E U   should   make   full   use   of   the   platform   presented   by   the   high level   economic   dialogue   to   strengthen   communication   and   cooperation   and   jointly   oppose   trade   protectionism   This   would   better   enable   us   to   tackle   the   current   crisis   and   promote   economic   recovery   and   growth   It   would   also   reinforce   the   trend   of   economic   globalization   and   facilitates   a   further   growth   of   two way   trade The   two   sides   should   work   actively   to   put   in   place   the   agreement   reached   at   the   G 20   summit   in   London   promote   early   comprehensive   and   balanced   outcome   in   the   WTO   Doha   round   negotiations   and   uphold   an   open   fair   and   equitable   international   trading   regime   An   early   conclusion   of   the   Doha   round   is   of   symbolic   significance   to   curbing   protectionism The   two   sides   should   further   open   markets   to   each   other   China   will   continue   to   lower   the   threshold   for   market   access   improve   trade   and   investment   environment   and   encourage   Chinese   enterprises   to   increase   procurement   and   imports   from   Europe We   hope   the   E U   will   relax   restrictions   on   the   exports   of   high tech   products   to   China   enhance   cooperation   with   China   on   the   development   and   application   of   clean   energy   new   energy   and   renewable   energy   and   support   cooperation   among   our   small   and   medium sized   enterprises   Meanwhile   our   two   sides   should   step   up   efforts   to   update   the   E E C .- China   Trade   and   Economic   Cooperation   Agreement The   two   sides   should   work   in   a   cooperative   spirit   and   properly   resolve   trade   differences   and   disputes   Each   side   needs   to   take   proper   care   of   its   own   interests   Yet   more   importantly   both   sides   should   accommodate   the   concerns   of   the   other   taking   into   full   account   national   conditions   and   their   stage   of   development   and   steadily   broaden   the   scope   of   our   common   interests We   should   strengthen   dialogue   and   consultation   refrain   from   taking   protectionist   measures   and   avoid   politicizing   trade   issues   China   hopes   that   the   E U   will   evaluate   the   conditions   of   the   Chinese   economy   in   an   objective   and   unprejudiced   manner   and   recognize   China s   full   market   economy   status   as   soon   as   possible Trade   liberalization   was   is   and   will   continue   to   be   the   only   way   to   global   economic   prosperity   The   Chinese   side   is   ready   to   work   with   the   E U   and   take   effective   measures   to   oppose   trade   protectionism   promote   better   growth   of   China E U   trade   and   jointly   move   the   world   economy   out   of   the   current   difficulties   at   an   early   date 新华网 北京 月 日电   李保东 纽约时报 网站 月 发表 中国
